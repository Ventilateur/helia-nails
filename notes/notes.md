# Notes

## Notification

### Treatwell

Websocket based notification

Endpoint: `wss://connect.treatwell.net:3050/?ruid=<uuid>`

The `ruid` seems to be random so it can be regenerated every time.


### Planity

Instead of this shit `s-euw1c-nss-2203`, probably we can use `planity-production-fr-11` as domain name in WS connection.
